# Pragmatic Developer Guide

Opinionated Guide for Software Development Teams that work on the same code collaboratively in an agile way (working on new features in increments).

The guidelines and proposed practices and tools have been proven to work in real projects and are tried to be kept as pragmatic as possible.

## How to reuse
You can reuse this guide as a blueprint for your project's development guide in your own project.

Just copy this book's markdown files (from book's git repository) and integrate it in your project repo's `docs` folder.

If you want to have same nice views as on the gitbook webpage for your project, you can easily setup the gitbook tooling accordingly in your project (which is very easy, see chapter about documentation).
