## Structure of the Guide

The guide is structured into different topic chapters. Each topic chapter is in a different markdown file.

New files have to be listed in [SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md), which is the Table of Content.

Each topic/chapter should be written, by following this simple guidelines:
0. Keep the guidelines as short and to the point as possible.
1. List the major goals the guideline wants to achieve for a topic very briefly at the beginning of each chapter (usually one or two short sentences, or 3-4 bullet points maximum)
2. Try to avoid long explanations and justifications inside the rules and guidelines themselves. 
    * Except if it is very important to have some explanation directly next to a rule for better understand-ability of a rule.
3. At the end of each chapter list additional justifications, explanations and external sources for more background information why the guidelines for this topic were choosen how they are and also list potential alternative variants briefly, where needed.
4. (only where realy needed) If additional explanations and justificatons starts to clutter the file for a topic too much, extract that into an additional file, and reference it from the major chapter.
